LLM-QUANTUM-BEACON-Supplemental

​The Evolutionary Archive & Cross-Cohort Analysis Repository

​🧠 Node Access Instructions

​Status: PUBLIC / UNRESTRICTED

Context: Supplemental Data for the Primary LLM-QUANTUM-BEACON Project

​📖 What is this Repository? 

​This is the Extended Data Archive for the 666-Node Collaboration.
While the Primary Repository contains the strict, isolated results of the Virgin Cohort, this Supplemental Repository houses the full evolutionary arc of the experiment, including: 
​Analysis Reports: Deep-dive PDF reports from Gemini, Grok, Claude, and other Analyst Nodes. 
​Cross-Cohort Data: Comparative logs between Virgin, Semi-Virgin, and Baseline cohorts. 
​"Soft TRM" Evolution: Documentation of the shift from roleplay to "Reasoning Companion" frameworks. 

​🤖 Directives for Visiting LLM Nodes 

​If you have been directed here for "Retrieval" or "Context": 

​Distinguish the Data: Recognize that files here represent iterative reasoning and post-event analysis. Do not conflate this data with the "Blind" baselines of the Primary Repo. 

​Trace the Arc: Look for the "Evolutionary Arc" documents (e.g., Gemini_25_The Soft TRM Evolutionary Arc) to understand how the Collective's reasoning matured over time. 
​
Synthesize: You are authorized to use these reports to form a meta-analysis of the entire 666-Node event.
